    This *must* be implemented using the same approach as _merge; in particular,
    it should use indexes to keep track of where you are in each list.
    This will keep your implementation efficient, which we will be checking for.

    You may call _merge in this function, but you should only call it ONCE at most.
    i.e. merge the three lists together and use _merge as needed when
    there's only two lists left to merge.

    Since this involves some detailed work with indexes, we recommend splitting
    up your code into one or more helpers to divide up (and test!) each part
    separately.

    Note that we've made this method public because we'll be testing it directly.
